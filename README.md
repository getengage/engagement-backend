This is the home for the Engagement backend. Please note, this is an <b>Experimental</b> project that utilizes Influxdb as a Time-Series DB for the backend as well as a JS Client that utitlizes new HTML API's with fractured support across browsers.

### Application Features

- See latest page visits
- Top 10 pages by Engage score, visit, and referral
- Historical view of page visits grouped by Engage scores
- and more

### Todo

- "Insights" section for predictive analytics of Engagement scores
- "Reports" for PDF report generation
- Better scoring algorithm
- Better UI Interface
